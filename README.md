CBAM ontologies and vocabularies

This repository comprises a set of ontologies and controlled vocabularies, which were modeled by applying ontology design principles and best practices. All the resources developed are based on the EU specifications.

## Ontologies

The modeling of entities within the ontologies was conducted using classes wherever possible instead of individuals, with classes organized hierarchically. Furthermore, content from existing ontologies was reused, whenever possible, to promote data interoperability and reduce the effort in ontology development.

## Controlled Vocabularies
Regarding the controlled vocabularies, the EU CBAM report template, provided in XLSX format, includes multiple tabs featuring coded value lists. These lists provide the permissible values for specific fields within the report.
