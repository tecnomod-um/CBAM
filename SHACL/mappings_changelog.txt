Is this correct? Yes.  I added the hasProductionUnit object property to relate Installation with SteelMill, then in the mapping is important to include the Installation and the SteelMill when neccesary
Becuase reading better, not the whole goods are producedAt an SteelMill, only those form Iron and steel, etc.  
Added object properties:  hasProductionUnit:  Installation - > SteelMill and the inverse isPorductionUnitOf SteelMill -> Installation
 the range of produced at INSTALLATION is a steel mill and not an installation? In the mappings we use "https://purl.org/cbam/cbamreport/isProducedIn", which does not exists.
https://purl.org/cbam/cbamreport/producedAtInstallation
	domain: Good
	Range: SteelMill
